                  <p>Today we will load the motor coach and off we go! We will begin with a grand overview of Kirtland. We
                      will answer these questions (and many more!) What brought the prophet to Kirtland? Why Kirtland? And
                      how did the Lord prepare the area for the restoration?</p>

                  <p>On Thursday we will visit the site of the Orange conference and learn about the witnesses to the Book
                      of Mormon. We will learn about the Saints who came to Kirtland from Orange. For lunch, we will visit

                  <h3>Day Four - Friday September 27th</h3>
                  <p>We have a GREAT day today! We will travel to the Community of Christ chapel in Kirtland where we will
                      be taught by the local Community of Christ pastor Nancy Cervi about their beliefs, and their
                      experiences as being stewards of the Kirtland Temple for nearly 144 years. Next, we will go and
                      learn about Sidney Rigdon in one of his church buildings. On our way to the Johnson Farm, we will
                      see the home that Lorenzo Snow was born in and make a quick stop at a cemetery to hear a story about
                      a member who left the church but couldn’t leave the church alone. We will have an in-depth
                      discussion on ‘The Vision’ and the impact that section 76 had on the world. Near the end of the day,
                      we will turn our attention to the temple, and we will learn about the Endowment of power and temple
                      ordinances that occurred in the Kirtland Temple. At the end of our day, we will visit an Amish home
                      and have an incredible home-cooked meal with AMAZING pies! While we visit, we will see how the Amish
                      live, and will be able to explore their property.</p>
