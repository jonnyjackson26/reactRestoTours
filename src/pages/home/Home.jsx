                <p>on an in-depth tour of church history sites around the Kirtland area. Learn about the organizational
                    period, the teaching period, and the Pentecostal period of the church as well as the events that led to
                    the transfer of stewardship of the Kirtland temple.</p>
                <p>No other tour will help you gain a greater understanding of the significance of the 7 years the saints
                    spent in Kirtland. No other tour will be able to teach you about the prophecies that the Lord had for
                    Kirtlandâ€™s future that we are seeing fulfilled today.</p>
