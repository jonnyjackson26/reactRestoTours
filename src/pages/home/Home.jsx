                        period, the teaching period, and the Pentecostal period of the church, hold an original Book of Mormon, and learn about the events that led to
                        the transfer of stewardship of the Kirtland temple. Also, learn about the belifs of the Community of Christ church, directly from one of their members. </p>

                        spent in Kirtland. No other tour will be able to teach you about the prophecies that the Lord had for
                        Kirtlandâ€™s future that we are seeing fulfilled today.</p>
