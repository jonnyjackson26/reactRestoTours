                    <p>Several have asked about the tipping for the bus driver. If you wish to tip this could be done at the end

                    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
                    <p>If you cancel: Deposit is non-refundable; however, it is transferable to another guest on a new booking,
                        traveling on the same tour date. After final payment, the full amount is non-refundable. If you cancel
                        and you can find someone to take your spot, we will refund the deposit. If we have a waiting list, we
                        will refund your deposit by placing someone in your spot.</p>
                    <p>The only way to avoid trip cancellation penalties is to buy trip cancellation insurance. If you are
                        interested in the insurance, we can help you purchase it.</p>
